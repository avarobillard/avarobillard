## Hi! I'm Ava Robillard 👋

I am an early career data scientist with a background in plant science! 🪷 I am currently pursuing my Master's of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management to expand my programming skills to broader sustainability challenges. Learn more on my personal website, [avarobillard.github.io](https://avarobillard.github.io/).

## 📖 Education
I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Plant Sciences and a minor in Data Science in May of 2025, where I concentrated in computational biology and did bioinformatics research on the phylogenetics of non-model plant species. 🧬🔬

I am expecting to graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara with my Master's in June of 2026!
