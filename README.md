<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Ava Robillard 👋</h1>

I am an early-career data scientist with a background in plant science. 🍄🌲🪲 Currently, I am pursuing my **Master's of Environmental Data Science** at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management to expand my skills in Python, R, geospatial analysis, machine learning, and data management to addresss broader sustainability challenges. You can learn more on my personal website, [avarobillard.github.io](https://avarobillard.github.io/).

### 📖 Education
I graduated from **Cornell University with a B.S. in Plant Sciences and a minor in Data Science** in May 2025, where I concentrated in computational biology and conducted bioinformatics research on the phylogenetics of non-model plant species. 🧬🔬

I'm expected to graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara with my Master's degree in June 2026!
